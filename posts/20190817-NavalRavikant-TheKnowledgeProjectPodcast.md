# Hacking Happiness: Deconstructing the World with Naval Ravikant

In this episode of The Knowledge Project podcast, Shane Parrish interviews Naval Ravikant, CEO and co-founder of AngelList, to explore a vast landscape of ideas, from reading habits and decision-making to the purpose of life itself. This discussion is a deep dive into Naval's mental models and approaches to living a more thoughtful and intentional life.

## Reading as a Foundation: From Comic Books to Philosophy

Naval's voracious reading habits began in childhood as a means to escape and explore. He emphasizes the importance of *unfettered access* to reading materials, even those considered "junk food" for the mind, to cultivate a lifelong love of learning. He transitioned from comic books to mysteries, then fantasy, sci-fi, and ultimately science, mathematics, and philosophy.

> "I just always loved to read because... I was just lost in the world of words and ideas from an early age... I think some of it comes from the happy circumstance that when I was young, nobody forced me on what to read." — Naval Ravikant

## Unpacking Habits: Deliberate Choices Over Unconscious Patterns

Naval challenges the notion that habits are always beneficial, pointing out that we often unconsciously accumulate habits that may be detrimental. He advocates for *deliberately choosing* habits that align with our values and contribute to our well-being, rather than blindly adhering to ingrained patterns. He also points out that some people don't actually break bad habits, and simply replace them with healthier ones.

## The Paradox of Happiness: The Absence of Desire

Naval describes happiness not as a constant state of positive emotions, but as the *absence of desire.* By reducing our attachment to external expectations and embracing the present moment, we can experience a deeper sense of contentment.

> "Today I believe that happiness is... a default state. It was there when you remove the sense that something is missing in your life." — Naval Ravikant

## Untangling Values: The Compass for a Meaningful Life

Naval defines values as non-negotiable principles that guide our actions and relationships. He provides examples such as honesty, long-term thinking, and pure relationships, emphasizing the importance of aligning our lives with these core values to create a more fulfilling existence.

## Education Reimagined: From Rote Memorization to Self-Driven Exploration

Naval criticizes the current education system's focus on rote memorization and standardized learning, advocating for a more personalized and self-directed approach. He envisions a future where technology empowers individuals to explore their interests at their own pace, fostering a lifelong love of learning and critical thinking. Naval also discussed getting rid of traditional school concepts and switching education to a system that helps guide people in their life, not for social approval.
