# Unlock Your Voice: Mastering Communication with Vinh Giang

Speaking with confidence isn’t a gift, it’s a skill. This episode with Vinh Giang unpacks exactly how to develop it. Giang, an award-winning speaker and communication expert, joins Steven Bartlett to reveal the blueprint to mastering the art of communication.

Here are some golden nuggets from their insightful conversation.

## The Power of Your Vocal Instrument
Giang emphasizes reframing how we think about our voice. It’s not merely a tool but a beautiful instrument: 

> I help people learn that they have access to one of the most beautiful instruments in the world, that can help them negotiate whatever reality they desire.

Understanding this shifts the focus from functional to playful, unlocking emotional expression.

## The 3-Step Communication Transformation
Giang introduces the "Record and Review" process:
1. Record yourself speaking.
2. Set it aside for a day.
3. Review in three ways: auditorily, visually, and via transcription. 

This process unearths non-functional habits and provides a pathway for conscious improvement.

## Speaking with Authenticity

Giang pushes back on the idea of having only *one* authentic voice. Embracing varied vocal expression doesn’t equal being fake. He argues that we often limit ourselves: 

> “Good. Honey, most people go through life speaking like this. I’m going to teach you how to speak like this.”

He encourages listeners to break free from familiar vocal keys and explore new emotional ranges.

## The Nuances of Body Language

Beyond vocals, Giang and Bartlett delve into the importance of non-verbal cues. Understanding your power sphere (the area between your belly button and eyes) is key to projecting confidence. Avoiding T-Rex arms and practicing open hand gestures enhance your physical presence.

## Is It Okay To Be Weird?

The fear of being perceived as “weird” often holds people back from embracing change. However, Giang points out that the path to growth lies outside our comfort zone. Seek feedback, and embrace the unfamiliar to iron out the kinks.

## Conclusion
This conversation with Vinh Giang provides actionable strategies for transforming communication skills. By reframing our mindset and embracing vocal techniques, we can unlock our full potential to connect, influence, and lead. This is more than a skill; it's a gateway to creating the reality you desire.
