# Rosé Gets Real: A Cathartic Conversation on 'Therapuss'

This week on 'Therapuss,' host Jake Shane welcomes the incredibly talented Rosé to the couch. The raw and unfiltered conversation delves deep into Rosé's creative process, anxieties, and the surprisingly therapeutic power of writing about them. It's an episode that promises not just entertainment, but genuine connection and relatable insights.

## Vulnerability as a Creative Catalyst

Rosé shares how initially terrified she was to write her own music, fearing that it would be perceived as inauthentic. However, she quickly discovered that being truly vulnerable and honest in her songwriting was the key to connecting with her audience.

> "All it is, is just us like chit-chatting, like girlfriends, like friends, out like for coffee, and then...putting that into a song." — Rosé

## Confronting Anxieties Head-On

The podcast reveals how Rosé navigates the anxieties of being in the public eye, as well as, more general stress and anxiety. She discusses her method of using music to process her feelings, and the power that has to leave the bad energy *in* the songs, rather than in her mind.

> "When you can really hear someone's like authentic feelings in it...it's really going to resonate with people." — Jake Shane

## Breaking Free from Societal Expectations

Rosé and Jake discuss how the need to work on something, create, or produce, can become an unhealthy obsession, despite its origin having been "for fun." Furthermore, it can become difficult to break from these patterns. They delve into the pressures women face to conform to certain roles and expectations, and the importance of pushing back against those narratives and living authentically.

## Self-Love & Self-Compassion as Daily Practice

Rosé talks about the recent efforts she's been making to speak kinder, more lovingly and compassionately, to herself. She shares some of the things she's been telling herself lately, in an effort to stay present and thankful for all the good in her life.

## Finding Humor in the Chaos

Despite the serious topics covered, the episode is filled with lighthearted moments and witty banter. The hosts' genuine camaraderie and playful energy makes it a fun and engaging listen. From their mutual love of squishy toys and Korean K-drama love show, the conversation is peppered with both silliness and sincerity.
